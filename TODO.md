- Change collision on paddle to manual -- just look at y of ball and if it collided
- Remove life if ball falls too low
- Start with ball stuck to paddle and button press to release
- Limit number of gun shots at any time

- Powerups:
    - Sticky
    - Extra life
    - Bomb
    - Flip
    - Shrink
    - Laser (can go through metal?)
    - SLOW

    - Animation when you get a powerup?
